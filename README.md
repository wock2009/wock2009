# WAF Detection Tool - Python Script



This Python script is designed to check if a website is protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF). The script sends a request to the given website URL and inspects the response headers for signs of popular WAF services such as Sucuri, Cloudflare, and others. If the script detects any of these WAF-related headers, it will notify the user that a WAF is present. Otherwise, it will indicate that no WAF was found
